{"cells":[{"source":"![NYC Skyline](nyc.jpg)\n\nWelcome to New York City, one of the most-visited cities in the world. There are many Airbnb listings in New York City to meet the high demand for temporary lodging for travelers, which can be anywhere between a few nights to many months. In this project, we will take a closer look at the New York Airbnb market by combining data from multiple file types like `.csv`, `.tsv`, and `.xlsx`.\n\nRecall that **CSV**, **TSV**, and **Excel** files are three common formats for storing data. \nThree files containing data on 2019 Airbnb listings are available to you:\n\n**data/airbnb_price.csv**\nThis is a CSV file containing data on Airbnb listing prices and locations.\n- **`listing_id`**: unique identifier of listing\n- **`price`**: nightly listing price in USD\n- **`nbhood_full`**: name of borough and neighborhood where listing is located\n\n**data/airbnb_room_type.xlsx**\nThis is an Excel file containing data on Airbnb listing descriptions and room types.\n- **`listing_id`**: unique identifier of listing\n- **`description`**: listing description\n- **`room_type`**: Airbnb has three types of rooms: shared rooms, private rooms, and entire homes/apartments\n\n**data/airbnb_last_review.tsv**\nThis is a TSV file containing data on Airbnb host names and review dates.\n- **`listing_id`**: unique identifier of listing\n- **`host_name`**: name of listing host\n- **`last_review`**: date when the listing was last reviewed","metadata":{"id":"bA5ajAmk7XH6"},"id":"c747d469-ee97-4b95-880f-feefd5456042","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"# Import necessary packages\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Import necessary packages\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Import CSV for prices\nairbnb_price = pd.read_csv('data/airbnb_price.csv')\n\n# Import Excel file for room types\nairbnb_room_type = pd.read_excel('data/airbnb_room_type.xlsx')\n\n# Import TSV for review dates\nairbnb_last_review = pd.read_csv('data/airbnb_last_review.tsv', sep='\\t')\n\n# Join the three data frames together into one\nlistings = pd.merge(airbnb_price, airbnb_room_type, on='listing_id')\nlistings = pd.merge(listings, airbnb_last_review, on='listing_id')\n\n# What are the dates of the earliest and most recent reviews?\n# To use a function like max()/min() on last_review date column, it needs to be converted to datetime type\nlistings['last_review_date'] = pd.to_datetime(listings['last_review'], format='%B %d %Y')\nfirst_reviewed = listings['last_review_date'].min()\nlast_reviewed = listings['last_review_date'].max()\n\n# How many of the listings are private rooms?\n# Since there are differences in capitalization, make capitalization consistent\nlistings['room_type'] = listings['room_type'].str.lower()\nprivate_room_count = listings[listings['room_type'] == 'private room'].shape[0]\n\n# What is the average listing price?\n# To convert price to numeric, remove \" dollars\" from each value\nlistings['price_clean'] = listings['price'].str.replace(' dollars', '').astype(float)\navg_price = listings['price_clean'].mean()\n\nreview_dates = pd.DataFrame({\n    'first_reviewed': [first_reviewed],\n    'last_reviewed': [last_reviewed],\n    'nb_private_rooms': [private_room_count],\n    'avg_price': [round(avg_price, 2)]\n})\n\nprint(review_dates)\n","metadata":{"executionTime":null,"lastSuccessfullyExecutedCode":null,"executionCancelledAt":null,"lastExecutedAt":null,"lastExecutedByKernel":null,"lastScheduledRunId":null,"outputsMetadata":{"0":{"height":59,"type":"stream"}}},"id":"1fdc5784-479e-46cb-b05b-68439dcc94a7","cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":"  first_reviewed last_reviewed  nb_private_rooms  avg_price\n0     2019-01-01    2019-07-09             11356     141.78\n"}]}],"metadata":{"colab":{"name":"Welcome to DataCamp Workspaces.ipynb","provenance":[]},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3 (ipykernel)","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"name":"python","version":"3.8.10","mimetype":"text/x-python","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","file_extension":".py"},"editor":"DataLab"},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":5}
